## Description

* My code reads in a file that has many items(with its status and its price). I have a function that matches
* Item together. For example, it finds a car that's for sale and a car that's wanted and if the price matches for 
* sale or is higher than the pair is a match. When I find a match it removes it from my array. Which then just
* leave what hasn't been matched. 

##File Description

* I only have my .cpp file. 

## Build descriptions
